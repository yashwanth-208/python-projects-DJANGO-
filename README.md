# python-projects-DJANGO- weather
To create a weather app using Django, you first need to set up a Django project by running the `django-admin startproject project_name` command and then creating a Django app within the project using `python manage.py startapp app_name`. Next, integrate a weather API such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI by obtaining an API key and installing the requests library for making API calls. Build a view function in your Django app to fetch weather data from the API, parse the JSON response, and extract relevant weather information. Design a template to display the weather data and pass the retrieved information to the template for rendering. Finally, start the Django development server with `python manage.py runserver` and access your weather app in a web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. This approach allows you to create a weather app in Django that provides current weather details for different locations. If you encounter any challenges during the process, feel free to seek additional guidance.
